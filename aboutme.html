                    My name is Ryan Zhang and I am a rising junior at Lexington High School.and previously I have taken a variety of programming courses, such as those found in MIT beaver works, using a variety of languages such as Java, C#, C++, Python and Bash. Additionally, I have also taken courses which implement AI using these languages. Additionally, I am also a programmer for my Vex Robotics team(8889a) and I utilize C++ to program motion algorithms which assist with our robot's autonomous routine.
                    
                    I am excited to explore all the different aspects of Computer Science and its uses in a business environment. However, I am not only ready to explore these aspects, but I am also ready to face the challenges that come with this exploration.
                    
                    As mentioned before, I have taken a variety of courses that utilize many different languages in different aspects of computer science. As a result, I have become well acquainted with a lot of development tools such as Visual Studios, Replit and Github. Alongside learning about these tools, I have also become familiar with the main 3 operating systems: Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
                    
                    I also have used AI to assist me with programming and provide ideas on how to solve an issue. Such as having AI proofread through my code, catching any subtle mistakes, and having it help me brainstorm new algorithmic ideas.
                    
                    Outside of robotics, I also participate in Boy Scouts and the part I love most about it is being able to go outdoors, have fun with my friends and make new friends as well. Additionally, I have also recently completed my Eagle Scout Project, which was building a bocce court at the Lexington Community Center. One highlight of this project was that I was able to spend time with others and work together with them to accomplish a huge task, which is a value that I think the most highly of.
